AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY SALES ANALYSIS

This project has been built for the usage of the Automotive Industry Planners. 
The project is a web application that predicts the future moto vehicle sales based on the economic 
and social factors of India. 
The prediction is done using the Machine learning Linear Regressor model.
 
The technology stack used in the project contains:
  >Python and its libraries for backend
  >Flask, Html, CSS for frontend

Getting an appropriate dataset was a challenge which was tackled by creating a dataset of my own by referring to the 
official resources like SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) and the World Bank.
I am planning to enhance this project by including company wise competitive analysis.

For running the web application, follow the following steps:
> Create a folder and save all .py files along with the "carsales" dataset that has been provided by me in the repo.
> Inside this folder create another folder named as "templates" and save all html files in it.
> Now run the "app.py" file in terminal.
> An url gets generated in the terminal. Copy it and paste it in the searchbar of any browser.
> Run it and the  web application is displayed.

The web app is static. It would give display issues with any device other than the one having resolution 1920 x 1080 x 59
